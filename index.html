                <p>
                    With 15 years of experience and counting, Armand Bley has fed his creativity and technique
                    in various fields of graphic design alongside numerous companies like Nike. An influence
                    transpiring in his work for Space Doge. <br> <br>
                    “ I’m in love with any kind of creative process, really. As an artistic director, I had to be the
                    junction between the will of an artist, the reality of the market, and restrictions imposed by a
                    brand. This time, with Space Doge, we can really set the creativity completely free to bring a
                    complete new vision of Art to the light. We’re working really hard as a team to bring new
                    ways to address the community without falling into cliché. It’s a continuous work of
                    balancing, and it’s absolutely thrilling.”

                    <p>NFT stands for Non-Fongible Token, unique digital assets that can be bought, traded and
                        sold. They usually take the form of some type of artwork, or even in-game assets for certain
                        virtual worlds. Each NFT is its own metadata codes, which are stored on the blockchain, to
                        ensure that they remain unique. In that sense, it preserves the rarity of the digital asset at
                        hand.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Yes it is, but not only ! In crypto, Mint or Minting refers to the phase when NFTs are
                        published on the blockchain and become available for purchase on Marketplaces (OpenSea,
                        Rarible, Zora). NFTs can only be purchased using Cryptocurrencies (well-known wallets
                        include Coinbase, MetaMask, Rainbow).</p>

                    <p>You’re right, we’ll be flying, not sailing, but OpenSea doesn’t actually refer to the vast ocean
                        in that case. It’s an online marketplace where you can buy, sell and store NFTs. You need a
                        wallet holding cryptocurrencies to be linked to OpenSea to start trading.</p>

                    <p>The Doge holds a strong meaning in the crypto community. It started out as a joke, the
                        “People’s crypto money”, super simple to use and trade, but it became more serious in time as
                        people with a lot of influence started showing interest. A lot of projects pop up everyday
                        featuring Doge or Shiba Inu, and we want to be the One project to make it truly shine.</p>
